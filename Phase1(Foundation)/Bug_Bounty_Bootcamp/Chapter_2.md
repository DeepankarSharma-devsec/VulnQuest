# 📈 Bug Bounty Bootcamp: Chapter 2 — Sustaining My Success in Bug Bounties

> *My takeaways after reading Chapter 2 of Vickie Li’s Bug Bounty Bootcamp. This one focused on what it really takes to thrive long-term as a bug bounty hunter — beyond just finding bugs.*

## 📋 Writing Better Reports = Winning More

I used to think bug bounty hunting was all about *just* finding vulnerabilities — but this chapter changed that perspective.

Turns out, a well-written report can make all the difference in whether your bug gets taken seriously, fixed quickly, or even rewarded. The better I communicate the bug, the more trust I build with the security team.

Here’s the 8-step formula I picked up for crafting a great report:

### ✏️ Step 1: Descriptive Title
Clear and specific. Not “IDOR found” — instead:  
`IDOR on https://example.com/change_password Allows Account Takeover`

### 🧠 Step 2: Clear Summary
Quickly summarize the issue with context — what endpoint, what parameters, what’s broken.

### ⚠️ Step 3: Severity Assessment
Use CVSS or platform severity calculators (HackerOne, Bugcrowd) to rate the bug. This helps teams prioritize it.

### 🔁 Step 4: Repro Steps
Make it *reproducible*. Assume the engineer knows nothing about your environment. Be explicit — screenshots help.

### 💥 Step 5: Proof of Concept (PoC)
Attach files or videos for complex exploits. Make it easy for the team to confirm the bug.

### 🧨 Step 6: Impact & Attack Scenarios
Spell out what a malicious hacker could do with the bug. Help them understand the real-world risk.

### 🛡️ Step 7: Suggested Mitigations
Only if I understand the root cause — otherwise I risk confusing them.

### 🔍 Step 8: Validate Everything
Double-check my own repro steps, links, payloads, and files before submitting.

## 🧠 Pro Tips for Report Writing

I also learned some pro writing habits:
- **Don’t assume** the reader knows what I know — spell everything out clearly.
- **Be concise** — cut fluff, jokes, and memes.
- **Write like I want to be read** — make it easy and pleasant to follow.
- **Always be professional** — tone matters more than I thought.

## 🤝 Building Long-Term Relationships with Teams

Something I hadn’t thought about was what happens *after* I submit a report.

Turns out, **good hackers help fix bugs too** — not just report them. That includes:
- Clarifying doubts when teams reach out
- Re-testing patches when asked
- Suggesting realistic mitigations
- Sticking with the case until it’s resolved

That kind of follow-through earns respect and builds real relationships with security teams. Some hackers even got job offers this way!

## 🔄 Understanding Report Statuses

This was super helpful to decode:

| **Status**       | **Meaning** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Need More Info** | The team couldn’t reproduce it — I need to clarify |
| **Informative**    | It’s not “important enough” to fix |
| **Duplicate**      | Someone else got there first |
| **N/A**            | Not a real issue / out-of-scope |
| **Triaged**        | Confirmed — on its way to getting fixed |
| **Resolved**       | 🎉 Fixed and bounty incoming (hopefully!) |

## 🚧 Why Reports Get Dismissed (And How I’ll Fix That)

This hit home. Some reasons my reports might get ignored:
- I didn’t read the program scope properly (reported out-of-scope bugs)
- I reported “valid” but low-impact issues (open redirects, cosmetic bugs)
- I didn’t think from the org’s point of view

> "If I were on the receiving end of this report… would I care enough to fix it?"  
I’ll ask myself this every time now.

## 🧱 What to Do When I’m Stuck

I’ve definitely hit slumps before. This chapter had some good advice for those moments:

1. **Take a break** – Walk away, come back fresh.
2. **Upskill** – Learn a new bug class, try mobile/API, read CTF write-ups.
3. **Switch targets** – Variety helps spot patterns and avoid burnout.
4. **Chain low-severity bugs** – Look for “weird behavior” and combine findings into a bigger exploit.

## 🧠 Final Words That Stuck With Me

> “Bug bounty hunting is hard. It took me months to find anything meaningful.”

This was really comforting. The book reminded me that the learning curve is steep — and that’s okay. The key is to *keep learning* and *keep showing up*.
