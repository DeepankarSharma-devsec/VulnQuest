## 🧠 Understanding the Bug Bounty Ecosystem

Bug bounty programs have gone from niche experiments to essential parts of security strategies for companies worldwide. Giants like **Facebook**, **Google**, and even the **U.S. government** are offering rewards to ethical hackers who find security flaws.

## 🎯 Types of Targets You Can Hack
When choosing a program, pay attention to the types of digital assets in scope:

- **Social platforms** (like Facebook): Great for interaction-based bugs.
- **General websites**: Often yield server-side bugs.
- **Mobile apps**: More complex, often require emulators or rooted devices.
- **APIs**: Prone to logic flaws and sensitive data leaks.
- **Source code** and **executables**: For reverse engineering pros.
- **IoT and hardware**: A niche, but growing area.

## ⚖️ Platforms vs Independent Programs

### ✅ Platforms Offer:
- Clear scope and legal coverage
- Metrics, leaderboards, and faster feedback
- Opportunities for private invitations

### ⚠️ Downsides:
- Third-party triagers may misinterpret your findings
- Less direct interaction with dev teams

## 🔍 What to Look For in a Program

### 🔐 Scope
- **Asset scope**: Which domains/apps are in or out
- **Bug scope**: Some bugs (like clickjacking or self-XSS) may be excluded

### 💰 Payouts
- Varies widely by program
- Unpaid programs (VDPs) are great for practice
- Critical bugs in top programs can pay **$10K+**

### ⏱ Response Times
- Fast turnaround = better learning & motivation
- Long delays can be frustrating, especially early on

## 🕵️‍♂️ Public vs Private Programs
- **Public**: Open to all, but very competitive
- **Private**: Invite-only, lower competition, higher quality feedback

> Tip: Submit strong reports in public programs to earn private invites!

## 💡 How to Choose the Right Program as a Beginner

Start with programs that:
- Have fewer researchers (less competition)
- Offer **large scopes** — more assets = more bug opportunities
- Provide community support or are known for good triage response
